<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Having a wandering path to success, as most of us do, I was able to pull all my skills together in communications, 
  marketing, advertising, real estate, and technology to carve out a niche for myself as CTO of a large real estate sales
franchisee</p>

<p>Part of my job is making sure that my skills are up to snuff so I am taking a basic full stack developer certificate 
  course through Udemy to refresh those skills that I don't use on a regular basis anymore.
</p>

<p>Mostly this is for me and me alone, but if you happen to have stumbled across these pages then I hope that you get a 
  kick out of what I have put together for you.</p>
