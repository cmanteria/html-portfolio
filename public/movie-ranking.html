<h1>Greatest Movies of All Time</h1>
<h2>These are must see movies according to Me!</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Star Wars - A New Hope</h3>
<p>This is the original. While all 3 of the first release were the best, this was the best of the best. I can set aside the weak special effects as they were top notch at the time this was put out. The storyline was amazing and engaging, and just action packed fun.</p>

<h3>Monty Python's the Life of Brian</h3>
<p>A classic fun romp through the beginning of the Christian religion. Brian is born nextdoor to Jesus and follows his path without having his success. As always this is a bit irreverant and hilarious</p>

<h3>The Princess Bride</h3>
<p>Fun, funny, full of action and adventure. It's got love, almost death, a villian, and a giant. What more could you want out of a movie?</p>
